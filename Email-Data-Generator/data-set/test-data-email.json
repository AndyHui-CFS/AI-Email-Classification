Recently, I went to a local public hospital to have a regular medical conditional check. However, the experience during the check was unpleasant and violating. It is suspected that the doctor performing the check did not follow standard procedures and guidelines. So, I would like to file a complaint against this doctor.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am writing this email to inquire what is the standard for filing a complaint against a doctor in a public hospital. Moreover, I would also like to know what documents or evidence are required to make the complaint.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful if you could provide me with this information.
